# SFMLFun
Just a place to test codes for SFML; mostly old stuff


SFML Test just has 4 squares and displays in the console which square you click on

CircleFollow just has a circle that follows the cursor on the screen

MoveablePendulum has a pendulum that oscillates - though it is not damped - and can be moved by clicking and dragging

Chladni simulates a computes the nodes for a square Chladni plate and draws them with circles
